"""
The "ExtraConfigCX" is used to put the CX in a known good state. This is achieved by
1) Having a CoreOS Fedora image ready and mounted on NFS. This is needed for loading
a known good state on each of the workers.
2) Then SSH-ing into the load CoreOS Fedora image, we can run a pod with all the BF2
tools available. https://github.com/bn222/dpu-tools/
3) The scripts will try to update the firmware of the CX with mlxup.
4) Then the worker node is cold booted. This will also cold boot the CX.
